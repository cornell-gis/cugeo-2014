# CUGEO 2014

Cornell Geospatial Forum  
Tuesday, October 14, 2014  
Martha Van Rensselaer Hall G71

Spatial analyses and place-based studies are more important than ever in the world today, and the digital technologies that support such work are becoming much more commonplace and in high demand. At Cornell we are at a turning point, as we face increasing demands and opportunities for support of geospatial research, teaching, and extension, while at the same time lacking a clear vision for how such demands will be met, especially as several key players from within our geospatial community transition out through retirement.

Help pave the way forward by joining us at our inaugural Cornell Geospatial Forum.  At this one-day event, we will highlight some of the many innovative and cross-disciplinary applications of GIS at Cornell, share ideas and research, learn about existing and emerging campus-wide resources, and lay the groundwork for the future of GIS at Cornell.  We hope you will join us for this important conversation, at the first of what we hope will become an annual event.

For more detailed background on this effort, please see our pre-event briefing paper, Sustaining Geospatial Science and Technology at Cornell University, which will be updated based on discussions and feedback from CUGEO.
